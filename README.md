# CommandLineInterface

A number of libraries to parse command line arguments (CommandLineInterface), set text attributes (TextAttributes), and a utilities library with functions to check if files/directories exits, list directory contents, check if numbers are NaN, infinite, or powers of two, create array indices, or print arguments into a string (for threaded output).

-----------------------------------------
 Installation
-----------------------------------------
The Makefile assumes that you have a ~/lib directory where the shared-object libraries from the CommandLineInterface are installed. This directory will be automatically created by the Makefile if it doesn't exist, and it's path can be changed by editing the LIB_DIR variable in the Makefile.
